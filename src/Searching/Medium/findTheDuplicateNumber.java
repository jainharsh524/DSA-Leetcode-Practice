    //We use Floyd‚Äôs Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection) algorithm.
    //
    //üîÅ Analogy:
    //Think of elements as next pointers in a linked list. A duplicate makes two nodes point to the same next node, which creates a cycle.
    //
    //Why this works:
    //Think of the array as a linked list where:
    //
    //The value at each index is a pointer to the next node (i.e., i ‚Üí nums[i]).
    //Due to the pigeonhole principle (n+1 numbers in range [1, n]), a cycle must exist.
    //The cycle is formed due to the duplicate value pointing to the same node more than once.
    //Approach (Using Cycle Detection):
    //Initialize two pointers:
    //
    //slow moves one step at a time: slow = nums[slow]
    //fast moves two steps at a time: fast = nums[nums[fast]]
    //Detect the cycle:
    //
    //Continue moving both until they meet. This confirms a cycle exists.
    //Find the entry point of the cycle (duplicate number):
    //
    //Reset one pointer to the start (index 0), and move both one step at a time:
    //slow = nums[slow]
    //fast = nums[fast]
    //The meeting point is the duplicate number.
