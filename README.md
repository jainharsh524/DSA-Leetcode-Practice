# 🚀 LeetCode DSA Practice in C

Welcome to **LeetCode DSA Practice in C** — a curated collection of my Data Structures and Algorithms solutions from **LeetCode**, now implemented in **C**.
I initially began this journey solving problems in **Java**, but due to college requirements and some recent circumstances, I’ve resumed my practice in **C**.

## 📌 About

This repository is built to:

* 📚 Practice and strengthen core **Data Structures and Algorithms**
* 💡 Improve **problem-solving** ability using C
* 🎯 Stay consistent with **technical interview preparation**
* ✍️ Track my **progress on LeetCode**

Each problem includes:

* ✅ Problem title
* ✅ Link to the problem statement
* ✅ C solution with clean logic
* ✅ Time and space complexity analysis (where applicable)

> 🔁 Previously, solutions were implemented in **Java**, and you may still find some Java files as part of the older progress.
> From this point onward, new problems will be solved in **C**.
